# AssemblyZero
Factorio Mod which adds an assembly machine zero to the game.

An assembly machine zero is a smaller (1x1 instead of 3x3)
and quicker (crafting speed 1.5) version
of an assembly machine 1.

# Installation
Download the zip from GitHub and unzip it in your Factorio mods folder.
The unpacked folder will most probably have the name "AssemblyZero-master".
You need to rename it to "AssemblyZero_#CurrentVersion" where CurrentVersion needs to be replaced by the version found in info.json
